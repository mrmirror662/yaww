hello, this not a fully automatic script,you cant fly the craft such a way it lands NOT on WATER .
required mod for craft file:kos ,kerbal reusability expansion,FMRS.
suggested mods : trajectories .

INSTRUCTIONS:
--> Fly the craft such that when decoupled, lands on solid terrain.
--> When decoupled, continue flying and using FMRS , come back after finishing mission to each stage.
--> for side boosters, run script in 2  KALs tagged as 'side1','side2'.
--> Repeat same for central booster.
--> turn on infinite temperature hack if overheats.
(fist upload , be merciful, thank you.)
